## Introduction

Character-level language models generate text one character at a time. These models are useful for generating text with fine-grained control over the output, such as programming code or structured documents.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of several key components:

- **Embedding Layers**: `nn.Embedding` layers to convert input tokens and their positions into embeddings.
- **Transformer Blocks**: Stacked blocks containing multi-head self-attention and feed-forward neural networks.
- **Layer Normalization**: Applied before each sub-layer in a Transformer block.
- **Linear Layer**: Projects the output embeddings to the vocabulary size for generating logits.

The model parameters can be adjusted via hyperparameters defined at the beginning of the script.

## Requirements

To run the model, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install torch
